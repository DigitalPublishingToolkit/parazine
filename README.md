## What is Parazine?
Parazine was created in the context of a the research project [Making Public](https://networkcultures.org/makingpublic/).

Parazine is a tool that allows you to recontextualize existing academic content. It scrapes the content from an online academic journal of your choice and allows you to create a ‘zine’ from this content. You, the source journal and the tool all provide certain inputs. The resulting publication needs to be printed to be readable. You can make a publication for yourself, but also consider creating it for others (e.g. as a reader).

## How do I run it?
First install [Weasyprint](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html). Version 51 is known to work.
Make sure you can run php and copy all files onto the server. Check read/write permissions to allow for the creation of cache and temporary files.
